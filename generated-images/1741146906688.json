The beds are arranged in a semi-circle pattern with crushed shell pathways between them. Golden hour sunlight filters through the scene, casting a warm honey glow on the weathered wood and illuminating the purple and pink blooms against lush greenery. A vintage galvanized watering can rests beside one bed, while delicate tendrils of sweet peas climb a whitewashed trellis in the background. The color palette features soft pastels against rich earth tones, with dew-kissed petals capturing the light.\n"}
